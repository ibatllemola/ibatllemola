## Hey there! 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for Front-End and creating clean, user-friendly interfaces.  
Right now, I’m diving deeper into **TypeScript** and **Node.js** to level up my skills in web development.

I love chatting about **web development**, **UI/UX**, and building cool stuff.  
Outside of coding, I’m a gamer 🎮, rugby player 🏉, sci-fi fan 🚀, and travel enthusiast ✈️.
